summary: Family of linear algebra algorithms for identifying the latent structure in data represented as a non-negative matrix. NMF can be applied for topic modeling, where the input is term-document matrix, typically TF-IDF normalized. Input; Term-Document matrix, number of topics. Output; Two non-negative matrices of the original n words by k topics and those same k topics by the m original documents.Basically, we are going to use linear algebra for topic modeling.
