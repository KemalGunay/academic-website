abstract: Technological development is the most important driving factor in the creation of new surveillance. The Internet of Things (IoT) has created the new surveillance term. The Internet of Things records and transmits large amounts of data which is being shared and analyzed in new and unprecedented ways to ensure the ubiquitous surveillance of individuals. This massive volume of data is called Big Data. The mass storage and accumulation of data makes it possible to monitor the lives of individuals. The IoT devices’ transmissions and the amount of data are increasing rapidly day by day. All these data are available for using perpetual surveillance. These data can be used for any government, commercial, legal issue. The data gathered from the Internet of Things provides an opportunity to surveil. Governments’ and companies’ surveillance tools have more access than ever in human history. This has revealed the concept of big data and has caused many different challenges in terms of personal privacy too. The IoT has been used in different areas, such as automation, health, building and home automation, transportation, textile industry and public services and so on. While it offers influential and efficient solutions to challenges of humanity, the surveillance aspect of it has always been questioned.
