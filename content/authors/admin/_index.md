I am a PhD candidate (Scholar) at the Faculty of Communication at Istanbul University. I will graduate in late 2022 My research interests are natural language process, social networks, statistics, social media / public opinion mining, political discourse & polarization and environmental & climate communication.

In my research I use a variety of methods and employ a wide range of data types, and am specifically interested in advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
